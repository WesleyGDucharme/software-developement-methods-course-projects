SENG265 - Software Development Methods

Course description

Systematic methods for designing, coding, testing and documenting medium-sized programs. Tools and techniques to promote programming productivity and software quality. Topics include specifications, code review and inspection techniques, testing and   debugging methods and tools, file system navigation, scripting languages, software tools, environments, instrumenting and profiling and the fundamentals of software configuration management.

The topics covered by this course include:

  - Linux command-line basics with Bash
  - C programming language
  - Dynamic data structures in C
  - Python 3 programming language and libraries
  - Jupyter Notebooks
  - Multi-version software development
  - Git version control system
  - Build tools such as make and makefiles
  - Incremental software development and testing
  - Software evolution and the software life cycle

Notable evaluations were 4 assignments and a term portfolio project. Assignments 1-4 were worth 9% each and the portfolio was worth 8%. A grade of A+ was received on all these assessments.

Assignment 1 is a pipes & filters program that uses conditionals, loops, and string processing tools in C to process song data and printing it in a different format. Dynamic memory allocatio is not used. File name song_analyzer.c in the a1 directory.

Assignemnt 2 is achieves the same purpose as assignment 2 though it is now done in python. Used Pandas extensively inorder to perform analysis on the song data and then wrote the outputs to a new csv file. File name is song_analyzer.py in the a2 directory.

Assignment 3 is the almost same as assignment 1. Done in C it's only difference is now we use C's dynamic memory allocation functions such as malloc and calloc to get our desired outputs. File name is song_analyzer.c in the a3 directory.

Assignemnt 4 is a random image generator developed using an Object oriented approach. Used an extensive number of classes and the random library to generate a random number of shapes such as circles and rectangles with random size paramaters within a some given ranges of values. The output of the file is an html image of a canvas with the generated images. The file name is image_generator.py in the a4 -> a43 directory.
